# Arena_and_exp

The Arena module is seprated in two submodules, the [Arena](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/tree/main/sehec/arena_and_exp/arenas) and the [Experiment](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/tree/main/sehec/arena_and_exp/experiments)
This is done because the Environment class can be initialised to use data from an experiment.
