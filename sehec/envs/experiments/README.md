# Experiment: The  standardised environment for the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex models.

## 1. Introduction

We use open-source data of the experiment to replicate the experimental condition.

 We hope to assess the performance of the models against a set of selected experimental observations, roughly categorized as qualitative and quantitative evidence.

## 2. Experiment-Implemented

We use the following data sets:


    1. [”Conjunctive Representation of Position, Direction, and Velocity in Entorhinal Cortex” Sargolini et al. 2006.](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/tree/main/sehec/envs/experiments/Sargolini2006)
 
    2. [”Hippocampus-independent phase precession in entorhinal grid cells”, Hafting et al 2008] (https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/tree/main/sehec/envs/experiments/Hafting2008)
   
One of our goals is to expand this list to add more experiments that are relevant to this literature and that are publicly available.

## 3. How-to-Contribute

1. Create a file that indicates where to download the data.

2. Create a class to read/filter the data following the template shown in the [Behavior_data](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/tree/main/Documents).

3. Cite the Data approrialty.

4. Create an environement Class for the experiment
