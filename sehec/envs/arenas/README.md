## 1.Introduction

The environment aims at replicating the experimental setting where behavioral data and possible recordings werecollected.  Each specific environment implemented to resemble an experimental setting should be created as a subclassof the main environment class.  We begin with creating a simple 2-dimensional arena, and we now plan to implementmore complex architectures used in experimental settings such as a T-maze or a cycle. We will work toward improvingeach of the environments through the projects, adding experimental specifications

## 2.Arena-Implemented

1. Any 2D Environmement
2. Merging Room

## 3. How-to-Contribute

1. Create an environment class to following the template shown in the [Env_Core](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/blob/main/sehec/envs/envcore.py) and the [Style Guide](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/tree/main/documents/Style_Guide). 

2. Cite the any resources approrialty.

3. Record your contribution.

All contribution should be sumbited through a pull request that we will later acess.
