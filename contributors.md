# Record of Contributions

Taken from the Turing Way.
*The `contributors.md` file and the contributors table in the `README file` together form the record of contributions .*

We recognise all contributions and acknowledge our community members fairly.
For example, using [all contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org) we update the contributors table with each person's name, where the emoji keys indicate the different tasks they have done (see the [README file]()).
We understand that different contributions mean different things to people and may translate differently towards their personal interest, skill development, value exchange and advancement of their careers.

Individual contributors are welcome to provide their details under the section "Personal Highlights from Contributors".
Organisational support and collaborations are listed in the section, "Collaborating Organisations".
Each organisation name and details will be listed separately followed by contribution details of each individual contributor from that organisation.

Please see the [community handbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/acknowledgement) for details on how you can be fairly acknowledged for your work.

## Personal Highlights from Contributors

Please use this section to highlight your personal experiences in The project and community.
You can also describe the impact the project may have on you or your team members such as in promoting reproducible, ethical, collaborative and inclusive research practices.

This record can be used in your personal or professional portfolio (profile, CV, resume) by describing features you have enhanced, goals you have accomplished, skills you gain, opportunities you receive, personal connections you make, individuals you support and values you create through your involvement in the project

* Short bio:
> Achintya is the Community Manager for the _AI for Science and Government_ research programme at The Alan Turing Institute. He has a BSc in physics and an MA in science journalism. Prior to joining The Turing, he spent over a decade as a science communicator at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in Geneva. He is also wrapping up a PhD in science communication from UWE Bristol.

* Personal highlights:
> It was a joy helping people who had never used GitHub before file their first issues and make their first pull requests. I also familiarised myself with the structure of the book and can hopefully help other members of the community make contributions to it in the future! It was a lot of fun co-working with so many wonderful people in a shared virtual space.

* More information:
> I love that the TTW repo is a place not just to contribute but also to learn, so I wasn't afraid of making mistakes in commits and pull requests. Itâ€™s helpful that so many knowledgeable members of the community are there to help!

* Personal Quote:
> _The Turing Way_ is an ideal place to gather collective knowledge from diverse experiences in data science and open research, and to learn by doing.
