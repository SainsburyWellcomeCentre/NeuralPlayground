## 1. Introduction

This document will serve as a ROADMAP for the project. 

## 2. Achieved

Here are listed the mile stone achived by the project team

1. Literature Review

3. Environement
    > Implement Any 2D Environment
    
    >   Merging room
    
    > Batch Environements 
    
4. Agent
      > Learning place cells, grid cells and invariances with excitatory and   inhibitory. Weber, 2018 https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/blob/main/examples/testing_weber_model.ipynb

     > A general model of hippocampal and dorsal striatal learning and decision making. Stachenfeld,2018   
https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/blob/main/examples/SRexample.ipynb
   
5. Experiments 
    > ”Conjunctive Representation of Position, Direction, and Velocity in Entorhinal Cortex” Sargolini et al. 2006
 
    > ”Hippocampus-independent phase precession in entorhinal grid cells”, Hafting et al 2008. 
  
6. Comparaison Board  
     

Congratulation Team !


## 3. Future

1. Literature Review

3. Environement
     > Implement Any 3D Environment
    
4. Agent
      > Implement an hippocampal and entorhinal cortex models of your choice.

      >  Develope a new model
   
5. Experiments 
    > Add Experimental Data
      
6. Comparaison Board  
    > Add comparison metric (eg. Grid Score,)


Let's go Team !
