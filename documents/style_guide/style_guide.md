# Style Guide 

We are following to the best of our abilities the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Style convention. Note: Pycharm has an inbuild checking framework that will help you follow the style guide. 

The naming convention is as follows:

1. Class variable : NameOfClass
2. Function/Methods/Variable: 
        Private: _name_private_function
        Public:  name_public_function
3. File name: name_file
