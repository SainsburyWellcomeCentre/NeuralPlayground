## 1. Introduction

This class includes a set of functions that control the ways intelligent systems interact
with their surroundings (i.e., the environment). An agent receives observations from the environment (reward, visual cues, etc.) and uses these to take an action which in turn will update both its state and the state of the environment, generating new observations. More generally, the Agent can be thought of as an animal performing the task in the simulated experiment. All agent types will be given a set of abilities that are summarised in the agentâ€™s main class. Each different model developed can be easily implemented as a subclass of the main one.


## 2. Models-Implemented

  1. [The hippocampus as a predictive map](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/NeuralPlayground/blob/main/neuralplayground/agents/stachenfeld_2018.py)

  2. [Learning place cells, grid cells and invariances with excitatory and inhibitory plasticity](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/NeuralPlayground/blob/main/neuralplayground/agents/weber_2018.py)

Each of the these models are implemented in a jupyter notebook in [Examples](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/NeuralPlayground/tree/main/examples) to facilitate the interaction.

## 3. How-to-Contribute

  1. Create a file that indicates the appropriate reference to the model

  2. Create a class to run the model following the template shown in the [Agent_core.py](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/NeuralPlayground/blob/main/neuralplayground/agents/agent_core.py) and the [Style Guide](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/NeuralPlayground/tree/main/documents/style_guide.md).
  When building a new model create a file named author_date.py.

  3. Create or add to [Examples](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/NeuralPlayground/tree/main/examples/agent_examples/) jupyter notebook for the new model where you can run the model in a chosen environment with selected experimental data
