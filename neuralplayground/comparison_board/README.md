## 1. Introduction

This class facilitates systematic comparison between all implemented agents and
experiments. In other words, the initialised Agent can be run multiple times with different selected experimental settings. The Agent is the higher level of the workflow tree, facilitating the comparison of one agent to multiple experimental results. The runs are automated in the background, and the results are displayed intuitively for comparison. The board will intuitively allow you to navigate between the different requested results summarised on the `home' panel. We want to restate that this won't constitute an objective judgment of the quality of an Agent to replicate the brain mechanism. Instead, this only allows an objective and complete comparison to the current evidence in the field, as is typically done in publications.
