# The  standardised environment for the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex models. (Environement  )


* [1 Introduction](#1-Introduction)


## 1 Introduction

The environment aims at replicating the experimental setting where behavioral data and possible recordings werecollected.  Each specific environment implemented to resemble an experimental setting should be created as a subclassof the main environment class.  We begin with creating a simple 2-dimensional arena, and we now plan to implementmore complex architectures used in experimental settings such as a T-maze or a cycle. We will work toward improvingeach of the environments through the projects, adding experimental specifications
