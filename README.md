## 1 Introduction

This framework will allow neuroscientists to easily contrast the different hippocampus and entorhinal cortex models against experimental observations. This new tool aims at standardising the methods of building and comparing models as well as reporting empirical evidences. The code is constructed of two main classes, an agent class and an environment class.  The agent can be thought of as the animal performing the experiment, and the environment as the experimental the where the animal navigates and performs a task.  These two classes are allowed to interact to reproduce the full experimental setting

We create this framework with the perspective that the neuroscience community should be able to continue its development by increasing the databases of model and experimental results without our intervention. Therefore, the software is made easy to use, facilitating future growth. 
This new environment will revolutionize how the theoretical models are proposed in neuroscience and push for easy access and implementation of new ideas.

## 3 How to Contribute

There are three main ways to contribute to the porject: 

    1. Implement an hippocampal and entorhinal cortex models of your choice.

    2. Compare its results to real experimental data.

    3. Work on improving the environment

Refere to the README.md files found in the files of intterest for further details on how to contibute to the project.
We inspire the Organisation of the Project from the Turing Way Guide lines.
