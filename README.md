## 1. Introduction

This framework will allow neuroscientists to easily contrast the different hippocampus and entorhinal cortex models against experimental observations. This new tool aims at standardising the methods of building and comparing models as well as reporting empirical evidences. The code is constructed of two main classes, an agent class and an environment class.  The agent can be thought of as the animal performing the experiment, and the environment as where the animal navigates and performs a task.  These two classes are allowed to interact to reproduce the full experimental setting.

We create this framework with the perspective that the neuroscience community should be able to continue its development by increasing the databases of model and experimental results without our intervention. Therefore, the software is made easy to use, facilitating future growth. This new environment will revolutionize how theoretical models are proposed in neuroscience and push for easy access and implementation of new ideas. 

## 2. Installation
For now, install using pip for local editing and testing
```
pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel 
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
pip install -e .
```

## 3. Project
Please refere to the [Road map](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/blob/main/documents/road_map.md) to understand the state of the project and get an idea of the direction it is going in. This open-source software was built to be collaborative and lasting. We hope that the framework will be simple enough to be adopted by a great number of neuroscientists, eventually guiding the path to the computational understanding of the HEC mechanisms. We follow reproducible, inclusive, and collaborative project design guidelines All relevant documents can be found in [Documents](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/blob/main/documents/)

#### How to run a single model
You will find in the [Examples](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/tree/main/examples) file a simple implementation of each single model and in a single Environment. The Agent and Environment class can be initialised to use data from an experiment. These two classes are allowed to interact to reproduce the full experimental setting. 

#### How to Run the ([Comparaison Board](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/tree/main/sehec/comparison_board))

A second way to work with the framework is through the [Comparison board](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/tree/main/sehec/comparison_board). This tool empowers the users to flexibly choose the models, Environments, experiments, metrics and plot they would like to run. The initialisation of the   are automatized in the background. 

## 4. I-want-to-Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the [sehec](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/tree/main/sehec). 

 1. Implement an hippocampal and entorhinal cortex models of your choice. [Agent](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/tree/main/sehec/agent)
    
 2. Add functionality to the Comparison Board to compare results to real experimental data. [Comparison Board](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/tree/main/sehec/comparison_board)
    
 3. Work on improving the arena [Arena](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/tree/main/sehec/arenas)
    
 4. Add an experimental data set [Experiment](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/tree/main/sehec/Experiments)

All contribution should be sumbited through a pull request that we will later acess. 
Before sending a pull request make sure you have: 

1. Checked the Lisencing frameworks. 

2. Followed them [Style Guide](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/tree/main/documents/style_guide).

3. Implemented and ran [Test](https://github.com/ClementineDomine/EHC_model_comparison/tree/main/sehec/tests).

4. Commented your work
